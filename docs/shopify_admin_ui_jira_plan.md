# Shopify Admin UI Implementation Plan - JIRA Project Documentation

## EPIC-001: Shopify Admin UI MVP Implementation

**Epic Description:** Develop and implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the Shopify Admin UI for our integration service that connects clinicians' Evexia Diagnostics accounts with their Shopify stores for lab test ordering and results management.

**Business Value:** This implementation will provide clinicians with basic information about our integration services while laying the groundwork for future enhancements. The initial manual installation approach allows us to validate our solution with customers before investing in a full-featured self-service platform.
